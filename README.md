# TailWindProject
- My project is basically based on the Tailwind CSS.
- Project has six parts and each part is representing different functionality of the  Tailwind CSS.
- First part is a header and header contains two section. One section is just contained the logo and the second section contain the navigationbar. In navigationbar, there are different options and each option has a sub menu which also show the further information about different pages.
- Second part is about the video part and in which we are showing the specific video which we copied from the official page of German Airway and for this I am using the iframe tag.
- In the third part, there is a text section .so it has three elements , first one is heading and second one is paragraph and third one is button.
- The fourth section has two parts, first part is about the background image and second part is about the tax and the applying link button which is on the front side.
- The second last Part contains a carousel slideshow which show the image and text side by side and I use the three image and text sections but for the animation I use the Internal CSS.
